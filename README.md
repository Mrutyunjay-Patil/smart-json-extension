# Smart JSON Chrome Extension

## Overview
Smart JSON is a powerful and user-friendly Chrome extension designed to enhance the way you interact with JSON data in your browser. It provides a suite of tools for formatting, folding, copying, and manipulating JSON content with ease, directly within the Chrome interface.

## Features
- **JSON Formatting**: Automatically formats raw JSON data into a readable and collapsible tree structure.
- **Copy Functionality**: Offers the ability to copy individual values, keys, or the entire JSON structure.
- **Expand/Collapse Controls**: Users can expand or collapse all or parts of the JSON tree to focus on specific sections.
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Enhances readability with color-coded syntax for keys, values, and brackets.
- **Active Tab Permission**: Ensures privacy and security by only activating the extension when the user chooses to do so on a specific tab.

To install Smart JSON, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine or download the ZIP file and extract it.
2. Open Google Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.

4. Click on 'Load Unpacked' and select the directory where you cloned or extracted the Smart JSON extension.
5. The extension should now appear in your Chrome toolbar and is ready for use.

## Usage
